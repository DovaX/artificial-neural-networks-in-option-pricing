Abstract: This thesis examines the application of neural networks in the context of option
pricing. Throughout the thesis, different architecture choices and prediction parameters
are tested and compared in order to achieve better performance and
higher accuracy in option valuation. Two different volatility forecast mechanisms
are used to compare neural networks performance with Black Scholes
parametric model. Moreover, the performance of a neural network is compared
also to more advanced modular neural networks. A new technique of adding
rational prediction assumptions to neural network prediction is tested and the
thesis shows the importance of adding virtual options fulfilling these assumptions
in order to achieve better training of the neural network. This method
comes out to increase the prediction power of the network significantly. The
thesis also shows the neural network prediction outperforms the traditional
parametric methods. The size and number of hidden layers in a neural network
is tested with an emphasis to provide a benchmark and a structured way how
to choose neural network parameters for future applications in option pricing.
